# Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment
This is the code repository for [Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/continuous-integration-delivery-and-deployment?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787286610), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The challenge faced by many teams while implementing Continuous Deployment is that it requires the use of many tools and processes that all work together. Learning and implementing all these tools (correctly) takes a lot of time and effort, leading people to wonder whether it's really worth it. This book sets up a project to show you the different steps, processes, and tools in Continuous Deployment and the actual problems they solve.

We start by introducing Continuous Integration (CI), deployment, and delivery as well as providing an overview of the tools used in CI. You'll then create a web app and see how Git can be used in a CI environment. Moving on, you'll explore unit testing using Jasmine and browser testing using Karma and Selenium for your app. You'll also find out how to automate tasks using Gulp and Jenkins. Next, you'll get acquainted with database integration for different platforms, such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL. Finally, you'll set up different Jenkins jobs to integrate with Node.js and C# projects, and Jenkins pipelines to make branching easier.

By the end of the book, you'll have implemented Continuous Delivery and deployment from scratch.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
public static class MyMath
{
   public static int Add(int a, int b)
   {
      return a + b;
   }
}
```

For this book, we will need various software, but everything is explained in the chapters of this book. A computer with at least 16 GB memory is advised.
